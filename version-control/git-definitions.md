# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

  Version control is a tool that allows you to track, review, and rewind progress on a project. It is useful because it streamlines managing projects.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  A branch in git is a copy of the project you are working on. It allows a user to make changes and progress on the project while preserving the integrity of the master branch/project.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  A commit is creating a save point in your version control in which you can revert back to as needed. A good commit message would be one that describes the changes made during that new edit.

* What is a merge conflict?

  A merge conflict occurs when a change is made at the same point in the same file in different branches. Git is unable to successfully merge branches until the conflict has been resolved.
