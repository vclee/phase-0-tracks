RELEASE 1:

1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

What I gathered from my research is that Linux is very open-ended, open sourced, characterized by ease and freedom of use and access.

2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to
your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

VPS and VMs are like an emulated computer that's available to use virtually, as if it's a real computer. VPS allow for hosting multiple different services for different purposes. VPS also allows for the user to have full access of the VPS' OS, and thus can configure it.

3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as
the root user on a Linux system?

For security reasons, it's not a good idea to run as root because you risk damaging your system and  unintentionally deleting files via bugs and mistakes.
